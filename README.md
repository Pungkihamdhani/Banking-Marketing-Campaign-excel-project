**Banking Marketing Campaign Project Overview**

In this project I'll be working on "Banking Marketing Campaign" dataset, it tells us about the number of conversions from a program campaign offered through communication channel conducted by Bank

For data analysis, I'm using excel for data cleaning, preparation, transformation, visualization, statistical analysis and dashboard, and there are several rows that impacted during the process and also some new rows were made to sharpen the result

First thing that I notice, that there were no primary key, no row that has unique value on each column, so I create "ID row" to distinct each customer

Next "age row", in this row there are too many values which vary from 18 to 80, so to make it simplier, I create "age range", the purpose is to group these values to certain age stages so when we create the visualization it won't be cluttered

Pivot table
A PivotTable in Excel is a powerful tool used for summarizing, analyzing, exploring, and presenting large sets of data. It allows you to dynamically reorganize and filter your data, providing a flexible and interactive way to look at different perspectives of your data set, below is one of the pivot table that I created
